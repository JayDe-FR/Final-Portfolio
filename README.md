👋🏽 Welcome!

---

This is my first attempt at making my portfolio. I used Bootstrap and some JavaScript to make it responsive and also add some interactions.

The projects shown were done on my own time or as part of the courses I've taken over the past six months. I will continue to update them so that I only have handmade projects.

📧 Feel free to contact me on Twitter if you feel like it, I would really appreciate your feedback.
